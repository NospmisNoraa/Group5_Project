# C-_Group5_Project
Our Project for Group 5

This is a Contact Management application. It allows users to add, edit, remove, display, and search for contacts. Contacts are stored in a text file for persistence.

This program will ask the user 7 options:

Add new contacts
Display all contacts
Remove existing contacts
Edit contact details
Search for specific contacts
Save contacts to a file
Load contacts from a file

The file created will be "contacts.txt". The user can also load this file into the program as well.
